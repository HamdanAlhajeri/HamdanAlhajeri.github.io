### 👋 Hey there! I'm Hamdan AlHajeri  

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at Khalifa University, set to graduate in Fall 2026. I am aspiring to learn robotics in the future, maybe create a large mech.

💻 **Tech I'm into**:  
- Languages: Java, Python, C and React


🏋️ **Fun fact**: If you see this I'm more likely to be at the gym than coding.
